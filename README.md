You can neither edit nor create Python Notebooks directly on GitHub. To edit these files or create your own, you will have to install Anaconda on your PC or use an online tool. For more information, please visit [Project Jupyter website](https://jupyter.org "Project Jupyter").

<br><br>

**Attention!** 

When editing and running these python notebooks, it is mandatory to have the file `notebook_importer.py` at the same folder of the other notebooks. This file is the resposible for importing .ipynb notebook files located at folder `modules` as python modules/libraries to be used on your code.
